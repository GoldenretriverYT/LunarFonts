# Lunar Fonts
Font loader / rasterizer for TTF format in pure C#.

This code is a direct port from the Delphi version which I ported some years ago from C. 
The [original C version](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_truetype.h) was written by [Sean Barrett](http://nothings.org/)

## Installation

    PM> Install-Package LunarLabs.Fonts

Since this is a .NET standard package, to use with .NET framework projects please set the target to .NET Framework 4.5 or higher, otherwise Nuget will give you installation errors.
